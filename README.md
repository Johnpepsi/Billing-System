# Billing-System
This project is about Billing System where I used lang of C++ with the IDE of Code::Blocks. This system tracks your spending, groceries, how much you spent for the day and all other varies spending. I created this project for myself and will continue to improve this system for my own project and to enhance my craft.

## What I used in this project
- As I loved tracking my frugal spending in my daily basis. I used #include <fstream>, to save the file when performing the system so user can still see the record of how much they have spend.

## Password
- I also built password for this system for fun, 'john' is password if someone is interested of cloning this project and run from your own machine.
